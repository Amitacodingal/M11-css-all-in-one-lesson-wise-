Cascading in CSS refers to the process by which the browser determines which style rules to apply when multiple rulestarget the same element. The term “cascading” highlights how CSS applies a hierarchy of rules, where certain rules take
precedence over others based on defined principles.



Cascading Order Breakdown
Here’s a simplified breakdown of the cascading order from highest priority to lowest priority:

!important: Highest priority, regardless of source.
Inline styles: Next in priority, unless overridden by !important.
Internal CSS: Styles within a style tag which apply only to that document. 
External CSS: Styles from external CSS files linked to the HTML document,which apply globally across multiple pages. 


Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade
algorithm is split into 4 distinct stages.

Position and order of appearance: the order of which your CSS rules appear
Specificity: an algorithm which determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
Origin: the order of when CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser
extension, or your authored CSS
Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
